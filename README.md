This project is on creating a band website. Which consist of the home/index page, about band members, music collection of the band, all the different shows that are upcoming, a booking page for users to book and watch the band perform, and finally a store page to promote the merchandise of the band.

## Design Process
The creation of this website is to promote the band, coolband123, which is a fictional band not based on any particular existing band. This can be accomplished by promoting the the music collection to let users have a taste and experience the music created by coolband123. If the users happens to really like their music, they can thus have the opportunity to book the band and watch them perform live, this in turn helps out with letting the band secure more gig as well. During coding, suddenly had a thought of incorporating a store page, as the band can also earn revenue with the store page helping to promote and sell their merchandise to any interested fans. The home and shows page are able to promote the sales of ticket. For the more dedicated fans who wishes to laern more about the band, they can explore the about us page which further details information of each band members and their history. As well as linking their socials for fans to follow them online.

## Features

## Testing

1. Tried clicking the submit button in booking page, the requires email message pop up.
1. Tested how the about us will look in media query and it was bad and inconsistent at first because of how the page is formatted. Used positioning in order for the words and pics to overlap for easier readability.
1. Clicked on the pictures of product in store page and it brought me to a unknown page because the page does not exist.
1. For booking page during media query, a text box was too big, had to reduce the width of it during media query.
